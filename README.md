Want to make your app faster and don't want to spend on extra infrastructure ? 

**REST-store** is: 

An in-memory, self-adjustting cache: 

- Helps reduce the number of requests for 'hot' information
- No noticeable footprint 
- No need for extra caching architecture (redis/memcache)

With request dedupping, batching, retrying and circuit-breaking:

- Process-wide request profiling and mapping
- Greatly reduces the number of requests
- Fully configurable

## Use cases
